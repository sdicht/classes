# HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL BACKGROUND

## Victorian Certainties vs. Modern Uncertainties

| **Victorian World (1837-1901)** | **Modern World (1890-1920)** |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **God** watches over everything | **Nietzsche**: "God is dead" |
| **Absolute truth** exists | **Nietzsche**: No truths, only interpretations |
| **Progress** is inevitable | **World War I** shows civilization's barbarism |
| **Reason** solves all problems | **Freud**: Unconscious drives control behavior |
| **Empire** proves British superiority | **Colonial resistance** questions imperial right |
| **Social order** is natural | **Class conflict** threatens stability |
| **Humans** are special, created by God | **Darwin** shows humans are just animals |
| **Communication** takes days/weeks | **Telegraph/telephone** = instant connection |

**Freud's insight:** Humans are not "master in their own house" - unconscious drives control behavior

# Modern, Modernism, and Modernity: Key Distinctions

| **Term** | **Definition** | **Literary Relevance** |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **MODERN** | "Of the present time" - simply contemporary | What we call current literature, technology, life |
| **MODERNITY** | Historical condition: "socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the Renaissance"  | **Writers respond to:** industrialization, urbanization, mass society, loss of traditional certainties |
| **MODERNISM** | "A break with the past and the concurrent search for new forms of expression"  (Britannica: "Modernism") | **Writers respond with:** stream of consciousness, fragmentation, experimental techniques |

**The Relationship:** Modernist writers use new literary techniques to capture the experience of living in modernity

**Example:** Joyce uses **modernist** stream of consciousness to show how **modern** urban people experience **modernity's** psychological fragmentation

---

# Baudelaire and Modernity ("The Painter of Modern Life", 1863)

> *Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent; it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.*

- The experience of constant change in modern urban life - crowds, fashion, the ephemeral moment

- **The artist's task** is "to extract from fashion whatever element it may contain of poetry within history, to distill the eternal from the transitory"

## Industrial Revolution: Country vs. City


| **Pre-industrial (1800)** | **Industrial (1900)** |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 80% rural | 80% urban |
| Everyone knows everyone | Anonymous crowds |
| Travel by horse | Railroad speed |
| Work follows seasons | Factory clocks |
| Extended families | Nuclear families |
| Tight communities | Isolation |


**Psychological impact**: Anonymity, speed, alienation, class tension


---

## The British Empire: Scale and Anxiety

| **Imperial Scale** | **Cultural Impact** |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Largest empire in history** | English becomes global language of power |
| **25% of world's land and population** | Wealth from colonies funds British culture |
| **"Sun never sets" - every continent** | Constant fear of rebellion and decline |

**Why This Matters for Literature:**
- **Identity crisis**: What does "British" mean when ruling 400+ million non-British people?
- **Imperial anxiety**: Literature reflects fears of loss of control and cultural decline
- **Global English**: Colonial experience shapes how English literature develops

![bg right](images/British_Officers,_1st_Bn_6th_Rajputana_Rifles.png)


**How the British saw themselves:**

- Believed their Anglo-Saxon race was naturally superior
- Had a moral duty to spread Christianity and "civilization" to "primitive" peoples ("White Man's Burden")
- Upper classes were born to rule both at home and in colonies
- "Stiff upper lip" = emotional restraint and duty over personal desires.
- Colonies existed primarily to serve British economic interests, providing raw materials while buying British manufactured goods.
- Some literature romanticized colonial missions and reinforced class and racial hierarchies.

---

## Ireland: Cultural Suppression and Literary Response

| **Colonial Control** | **Cultural Impact** |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| **700+ years of control** | Irish Gaelic nearly extinct by 1900 |
| **Direct rule from London** | Traditional practices and customs banned |
| **Economic exploitation & famine** | Mass starvation and forced emigration |
| **Educational control** | Identity crisis: neither fully Irish nor English |

**Literary Consequence**: Irish writers like Joyce, Yeats, and others develop new techniques to express cultural displacement and fragmented identity

## The Great War (1914-1919)


| **Traditional War Poetry (Before 1914)** | **World War I Reality (1914-1918)** |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Individual soldiers, personal combat | **Machine guns**: 600 rounds/minute kill hundreds instantly |
| Cavalry charges, skill and courage matter | **Artillery**: Death from miles away, totally random |
| Honor determines survival | **Poison gas**: Science becomes murder weapon |
| Clear enemies, face-to-face fighting | **Trenches**: 25,000 miles of industrial death landscape |
| Noble sacrifice for country | **Scale**: 10 million dead, entire generation wiped out |
| "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" | **Speed**: 60,000 British casualties in one day (Somme) |

- Traditional heroic language becomes meaningless - new forms needed to represent unprecedented horror
- Comparison: "The Soldier" vs. "Dulce et Decorum Est"

---

**Excerpt from Wilfred Owen's "Dulce et Decorum Est":**

> *If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood  
> Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs...  
> My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  
> To children ardent for some desperate glory,  
> The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est  
> Pro patria mori.*

Latin: "it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country"

## Stream of Consciousness vs. Traditional Narration

**Victorian/Realist - George Eliot, *Middlemarch* (1871-72)**:
> Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day's newspaper. She was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common-sense.

- Opening sentences introducing Dorothea Brooke through external description. The omniscient narrator describes her physical appearance (beauty enhanced by plain dress), makes cultural comparisons (religious art, biblical quotations), and notes how others perceive her intelligence versus her sister's practicality.

---

**Modernist - James Joyce, *Ulysses* (1922)**

> Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.

- From the "Proteus" episode early in the novel (page 31), where Stephen Dedalus walks alone on a beach in Dublin, lost in philosophical thoughts about perception and reality. His mind jumps between Aristotelian philosophy, what he sees on the beach (seaweed, a boot), and abstract concepts about how we know the physical world through our senses.

## Victorian vs. Modernist: Narrative Techniques

| **Element** | **Victorian Literature** | **Modernist Literature** |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Narrative Voice** | Omniscient narrator describes and explains | Character's consciousness flows directly |
| **Sentence Structure** | Complex, balanced, complete thoughts | Fragmented, associative, incomplete |
| **Focus** | External description and social context | Internal thought processes and perception |
| **Language** | Formal, literary, publicly shared discourse | Colloquial, philosophical, private mental language |
| **Reader's Work** | Follow narrator's guidance and interpretation | Piece together meaning from mental fragments |
| **Time** | Present moment described from outside | Immediate experience as it happens in mind |
| **Cultural References** | Shared (Bible, art, poetry) for social positioning | Specialized (philosophy) for individual thinking |

---

# Point of View Transformation


| **Traditional** | **Transitional** | **Modernist** |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Omniscient Narrator** | **Limited Perspective** | **Stream of Consciousness** |
| Many Victorian novels | Late Victorian/early modernist | Modernist innovatio) |
| Knows everything | Shows uncertainty | Direct thoughts |
| Reliable information | Unreliable narrators | Multiple voices |
| Linear time | Fragmented time | Psychological time |
| External observation | Limited access | Interior consciousness |

**Note**: Victorian fiction uses various techniques - omniscient narration is common but not universal. Some Victorian novels already experiment with limited perspective and unreliable narrators.

---

# In Poetry: Fragmentation and Juxtaposition

## Example: Ezra Pound's "In a Station of the Metro" (1913)

```
The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough.
```

**Two images juxtaposed** without explanation - reader must find the connection between urban faces and natural petals.

- **Imagist technique:** "Direct treatment of the thing" - present clear, hard images without explanation or sentiment
