# Block 2: Likes, Dislikes & Interests

## Key patterns:
- like/love/enjoy/hate + **-ing**: "loves **solving** mysteries"
- interested in + noun/**-ing**: "interested in psychology"
- good/bad at + **-ing**: "good at **observing**"
- can't stand + **-ing**: "can't stand **being** bored"

## Common mistakes:
- NOT "likes read" → ✓ "likes reading"
- NOT "interested on" → ✓ "interested in"

## Block 3: Connecting Ideas

### Unit 97: Conjunctions for Complex Descriptions

- **AND:** adds information
- **BUT:** shows contrast
- **OR:** shows alternatives
- **SO:** shows result/consequence
- **BECAUSE:** shows reason/cause

### Position matters:
- "He's brave **because** he overcame fear" ✓
- "**Because** he overcame fear, he's brave" ✓
  (Beginning with 'because' = comma needed)

---

"Professor Moriarty **usually** appears **perfectly** respectable **and** speaks **eloquently** in academic circles, **but** he controls London's criminal underworld **ruthlessly** **and** plans crimes **meticulously**. He **rarely** commits crimes **personally** **because** he prefers working **intellectually** through others, **so** the police **never** connect him **directly** to anything illegal. He **enjoys** matching wits with Holmes **intensely**, **but** he **sometimes** acts **recklessly** when challenged **because** he **can't** stand being outsmarted **publicly**."
