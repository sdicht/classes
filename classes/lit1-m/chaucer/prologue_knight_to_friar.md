## Genre: Estates Satire

### Medieval System of the Three Estates (Ancien Régime)

| Estate | Function | Ideal |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Those Who Pray** | Intercede | Parson |
| **Those Who Fight** | Protect | Knight |
| **Those Who Work** | Sustain | Plowman |

The estates satire is a widespread medieval genre that analyzes society by enumerating classes or professions and showing how they fall short of an ideal

## How does Chaucer differ from the tradition?

- Focuses on single individuals (e.g., "a Friar, not friars in general") though pilgrims are still primarily known by their profession
- Increases historical authenticity by choosing professions one would find realistically, like franklins, dyers, shipmen, manciples, and summoners, rather than kings or cardinals
- Uses irony through superlatives, often stating that pilgrims are "the best of their kind". 
- Moral judgment shifts to the reader's interpretation of cues

## Structure of the General Prologue

- The General Prologue shows how the tales came to be told and introduces the characters

1. **Opening** (lines 1-18)
2. **Portraits** (lines 19-714)
3. **Contest** (lines 715-858)

- Character arrangement follows **social hierarchy** with significant exceptions that reveal tensions
- The content of individual portraits varies, focusing on appearance, past life, self-image, ethics, or tastes

## The Opening: Middle English (Lines 1-18):
```
Whan that Aprill with his shoures sote
The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote, 
And bathed ­every veyne in swich licour,
Of which vertu engendred is the flour; 
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth 
Inspired hath in ­every holt and heeth
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne 
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-­ronne;
And smale fowles maken melodye, 
That slepen al the night with open yë— 
So priketh hem Nature in hir corages-
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages, 
And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,
To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes; 
And specially, from ­ every shires ende
Of Engelond to Caunterbury they wende,
The holy blisful martir for to seke, 
That hem hath holpen, whan that they ­were seke.
```

### The Opening (lines 1-18)

- Reverdie: Spring song established genre in medieval literature
  - Ex: *Roman de la Rose* (translated by Chaucer) and *Piers Plowman* (William Langland) also begin with spring scenes
- Prologue begins with Western celebration of spring (general) and focuses on a local event of English society and Christendom (specific)
- Evolution from a natural activity to a human activity

**Secular Impulse**
- Spring awakens the natural desire for movement and renewal and human desire matches natural cycles
- After winter confinement, people want to travel and go on holiday 

**Sacred Impulse**
- People seek spiritual healing from saint
- Pilgrimage as religious duty and gratitude

**Both impulses can coexist** - the secular desire for renewal and pleasure, and the sacred quest for healing

## The Narrator, Chaucer the Pilgrim (lines 19-42)

```
Bifel that, in that seson on a day, 
In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay 
Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage 
To Caunterbury with ful devout corage
```
- Chaucer employs the persona of "Chaucer the pilgrim," a fictional narrator who ignores the significance of much of what he sees
- Apparently naive and tends to employ superlatives to describe various figures, even those devoid of genuine virtue, leading to irony and critical distance

---

## The Narrator: Chaucer the Pilgrim (lines 19-42)

- The narrator appears **naive and accepting** - he describes shocking behavior without seeming to understand what's wrong with it
- This lets Chaucer criticize corrupt religious figures **indirectly** - readers see the problems even when the narrator doesn't
- Chaucer creates **three levels of understanding** that work at the same time:

1. **What each character thinks about themselves** → often shows self-deception and vanity
2. **What the narrator tells us** → sounds like praise but includes damaging details  
3. **What the reader actually sees** → the truth behind the appearances

# The Pilgrims' Portraits
## From the Knight to the Friar

![bg right](compressed/1024px-Chaucer_knight.jpg)

---

## The Knight (43-78)

```
A Knight ther was, and that a worthy man,
That fro the tyme that he first bigan 
To ryden out, he loved chivalrye, 
Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye.
```

- Function of a knight: defense of Christendom through arms, maintain social order as elite warrior of feudal hierarchy.
- One of the few pilgrims described **without irony** by Chaucer, representing the medieval Christian ideal, with the Crusades as legitimate holy wars
- Sets up an ideal of perfectibilty to help us see how the others fall short

![bg right](compressed/The_Knight_-_Ellesmere_Chaucer.jpg)

---

## The Squire (79-100)

```
Embrouded was he, as it­ were a mede
Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and rede.
Singinge he was, or floytinge, al the day; 
He was as fresh as is the month of May.
```
- Young courtly lover (art, music, embroidery, youth) in contrast to his father, Christian warrior (crusades, modesty, experience)
- Skilled in courtly accomplishments like singing, playing flute, versifying, jousting, dancing, drawing and writing
- Represents the other side of chivalry: romantic love and artistic refinement rather than religious duty and warfare

![bg right](compressed/The_Squire_-_Ellesmere_Chaucer.jpg)

---

## The Yeoman (101-117)

```
And on that other syde a gay daggere,
Harneised wel, and sharp as point of spere; 
A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene. 
An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene;
```
- The Knight's servant, **a forester** who travels with only the Knight and Squire
- **Portrait focuses entirely on external details**: his weapons, equipment, and Saint Christopher medal
- **Social position**: one step above a groom, represents the skilled working class who serve the nobility
- His well-maintained gear suggests **professional competence** and the Knight's ability to afford quality servants

---

## The Prioress (118-162)

```
At mete wel y-­taught was she with alle: 
She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle, 
Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.
Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe
That no drope ne fille upon hire brest.
```

- Nuns should dedicate themselves to prayer, charity and simplicity
- Focuses on refined etiquette instead of religious devotion; perhaps by imitation
- Description focuses on lady-like appearance and behavior
- Aspiring to aristocratic, potentially romantic, ideals
- Brooch: *AMOR* vs *CARITAS*

![bg right](compressed/The_Prioress_-_Ellesmere_Chaucer.jpg)

---

## Other religious figures: Another Nun and Three Priests (163-4)

```
Another Nonne with hire hadde she,
That was hir chapeleyne, and Preestes three.
```

- Chaucer does not individualize them; they function only as status symbols for the Prioress
- She travels as an aristocratic lady, not as a humble nun
- The silence about these characters contrasts with detailed descriptions of the corrupt

![bg right](compressed/The_Second_Nun_-_Ellesmere_Chaucer.jpg)


---

## The Monk (165-207)

```
The reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit,
By cause that it was old and somdel streit,
This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,
And held ­after the newe world the space.
```

- Monks take vows of poverty, chastity, silence, and obedience through cloistered asceticism and devotion
- This one disregards traditional monastic rules, using his own arguments to justify his worldly lifestyle
- Loves horses, hunting, and eating

![bg right](compressed/The_Monk_-_Ellesmere_Chaucer.jpg)

---

## The Friar (208-269)

```
In alle the ordres foure is noon that can 
So muchel of daliaunce and fair langage.
He hadde maad ful many a mariage 
Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.
```

- Friars are mendicants who live on alms, preach outside monasteries, supported by donations, and serve the poor
- Seduces young ladies and pays for their wedding out of his own pocket as cover
- Should serve the poor and the sick but prefers taverns and wealthy people

![bg right](compressed/The_Friar_-_Ellesmere_Chaucer.jpg)

## Chaucer's Technique

Through his approach, Chaucer reveals a world where:

- **Physical details carry moral meaning**: a character's appearance and possessions reveal their true nature
- **The narrator describes without judging**: he tells us what he sees but doesn't explain what's wrong
- **Readers must figure out the truth**: we piece together the real story from the clues Chaucer gives us
- **Appearance contradicts reality**: characters often aren't what they seem to be

This technique lets Chaucer criticize medieval society without preaching - the characters reveal their own flaws through their actions and choices.

---

## Complexity of Characterization

Chaucer builds on medieval ideas about appearance revealing character, but makes them more complex:

- **Medieval convention**: beautiful = good, ugly = evil
- **Chaucer**: appearance still matters, but characters have individual personalities beyond their social roles
- **Dual nature**: each pilgrim represents their entire social class while also being a unique person

### Example
- **As a type**: The Monk represents all monks socially, and all corrupt religious figures who abandon their vows morally
- **As an individual**: This particular Monk with his shining bald head who loves eating roasted swan
