<h2 id="1-the-prioress">1. The Prioress</h2>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A prioress (nun) should be humble, help the poor, and focus on spiritual matters.</p>
<p>But look at what Chaucer shows us:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">She</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">wolde</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">wepe</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">that</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">she</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">saugh</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">mous</span>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar
A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene,
And theron heng a brooch of gold ful sheene,
On which ther was first write a crowned A,
And after Amor vincit omnia.

<p><strong>Translation in your own words:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Should a nun wear expensive jewelry? What does "Love conquers all" mean in a religious vs. secular context?</p>

<h2 id="2-the-monk">2. The Monk</h2>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Monks took vows of poverty, obedience, and staying in the monastery. They should follow Saint Benedict's rules, for instance.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>The reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit,
By cause that it was old and somdel streit,
This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace,
And heeld after the newe world the space.
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Translation in your own words:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong>
1. What should a monk's attitude be toward ancient religious rules?
2. What does the term <code>newe world</code> suggest about his priorities?
3. How does this connect to medieval concerns about Church corruption?</p>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-the-friar">3. The Friar</h2>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Friars took vows of poverty and were supposed to help the poor through charity. They should hear confessions and give spiritual guidance, not seek profit.</p>
<h3 id="quote-a">Quote A:</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Ful swetely herde he confessioun,
And plesaunt was his absolucioun.
He was an esy man to yeve penaunce,
Ther as he wiste to have a good pitaunce.
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Translation in your own words:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What's wrong with giving "easy penance" when you expect a good payment?</p>
<p><strong>Your answer:</strong></p>
<h3 id="quote-b">Quote B:</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>In alle the ordres foure is noon that kan
So muchel of daliaunce and fair langage.
He hadde maad ful many a mariage
Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Translation in your own words:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why would a friar need to arrange marriages "at his own cost"? What does this suggest about his relationships with young women?</p>
<p><strong>Your answer:</strong></p>

<h2 id="4-the-knight">4. The Knight</h2>
<p>Context: One of the few pilgrims described without irony by Chaucer, representing the medieval Christian ideal, with the Crusades as legitimate holy wars</p>
<p>Quote:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>A Knight ther was, and that a worthy man,
That fro the tyme that he first bigan
To ryden out, he loved chivalrye,
Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye.
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>Even though he is violent and kills people in holy wars, he is the ideal Christian soldier. He sets up an ideal of perfectibilty to help us see how the others fall short.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="5-synthesis">5. Synthesis</h2>
<p>Choose the Prioress, Monk, or Friar and explain how Chaucer uses <strong>contrast</strong> to reveal character. Think about:
- What they should be vs. what they are
- What they say vs. what they do<br />
- Surface appearance vs. reality</p>
<p><strong>Character chosen:</strong> <strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong>______</p>
<p><strong>Your analysis:</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="food-for-thought-well-come-back-to-this">Food for thought (we'll come back to this!)</h3>
<p>Can you think of modern/contemporary equivalents of these characters? What about examples where people in positions of authority don't live up to their ideals? How might a modern satirist approach similar themes and construct similar complex characters?</p>
