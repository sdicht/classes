<h2 id="dublins-economic-decline">Dublin's Economic Decline</h2>
<p>By 1904, Dublin was a city in economic crisis. The population of approximately 300,000 was declining from its previous peak, and the city was no longer the second largest in the British Isles.</p>
<p><strong>Employment was severely limited:</strong>
- Building trades, brewing, domestic service, and dock work provided most jobs
- Professional opportunities were rare and mostly restricted to Protestants
- A shop girl like Eveline earned 7 shillings per week
- Basic rent cost 15 shillings weekly</p>
<p>Constant emigration to America and Australia as young people sought opportunities unavailable in Ireland.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="religious-demographics-and-power">Religious Demographics and Power</h2>
<p><strong>Population breakdown:</strong> 83% Catholic (mostly working/lower middle class) vs. 17% Protestant (dominated professions and business)</p>
<p><strong>Catholic disadvantages included:</strong>
- Exclusion from Trinity College until 1873
- Limited access to law, medicine, and higher civil service
- Banking and major businesses controlled by Protestants
- The Catholic University (founded 1854) still developing reputation</p>
<p>Catholics were largely confined to lower-level positions: clerks, shop assistants, minor government officials.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="womens-legal-and-economic-position">Women's Legal and Economic Position</h2>
<p><strong>Legal constraints were severe:</strong>
- Married women had no property rights under "coverture" laws
- Husbands legally controlled wives' earnings and major decisions
- Divorce was virtually impossible for Catholics</p>
<p><strong>Employment options were extremely limited:</strong>
- Domestic service (maids, cooks, housekeepers) - most common
- Shop work like Eveline's at "the Stores" - survival wages only
- Teaching or nursing - mainly available through religious orders
- Factory work - very limited in Dublin's economy</p>
<p><strong>Marriage as economic necessity:</strong>
- Often postponed to late 20s/30s due to financial constraints
- Dowries required - families saved for years
- Social pressure: "bad marriage better than free womanhood"
- Spinsterhood meant economic vulnerability and social stigma</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="catholic-church-social-control">Catholic Church Social Control</h2>
<p><strong>Educational system:</strong>
- National schools (basic literacy for working class)
- Christian Brothers schools (working-class boys)
- Convent schools (girls)
- Jesuit schools like Clongowes and Belvedere (middle-class Catholic boys)</p>
<p><strong>Moral authority permeated daily life:</strong>
- Weekly confession monitored personal behavior and thoughts
- Temperance movements campaigned against alcohol
- Strict control over sexual behavior and marriage decisions
- Censorship of "dangerous" reading material</p>
<p>The Church's influence shaped the psychology and decision-making of Catholics throughout Dublin.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-great-irish-emigration-1841-1921">The Great Irish Emigration (1841-1921)</h2>
<p><strong>The scale:</strong> Approximately 8 million Irish people emigrated, with peak years in the 1880s-1900s.</p>
<p><strong>Who left:</strong>
- Young adults aged 18-30 (peak productive years)
- Single women in large numbers (unusual for global migration)
- Both rural poor and urban working class
- Those with education and skills ("brain drain")</p>
<p><strong>Cultural impact:</strong>
- "American wakes" - farewell parties assuming permanent separation
- Letters and money sent home with promises of new opportunities
- Mixed success stories - some prospered, many faced exploitation</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="employment-patterns-by-gender">Employment Patterns by Gender</h2>
<p><strong>Men's typical jobs:</strong>
- Government clerks (insurance, civil service)
- Shop assistants in city center stores
- Minor civil servants (post office, municipal offices)
- Dock workers, building trades (irregular employment)
- Small professional class (mostly Protestant)</p>
<p><strong>Women's typical jobs:</strong>
- Domestic servants (largest category)
- Shop girls like Eveline
- Seamstresses, milliners (clothing trades)
- Elementary school teachers (if educated)
- Marriage (often the only path to economic security)</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="cultural-movements-of-the-1890s-1900s">Cultural Movements of the 1890s-1900s</h2>
<p><strong>Irish Literary Revival:</strong> W.B. Yeats and Lady Gregory promoted Celtic mythology and folklore. The Abbey Theatre (1904) developed Irish dramatic traditions using English language but Irish themes.</p>
<p><strong>Gaelic League (1893):</strong> Promoted Irish language revival through cultural classes, traditional music, and dancing. Connected to growing political nationalism.</p>
<p><strong>Joyce's position:</strong> Remained skeptical of both movements, favoring a cosmopolitan outlook that saw Dublin as a European city rather than an isolated Celtic culture.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="consumer-culture-and-new-modernity">Consumer Culture and New Modernity</h2>
<p><strong>Commercial changes:</strong>
- Department stores replacing traditional small shops
- Advertising and brand names becoming common
- Ready-made clothing competing with custom tailoring
- Imported luxury goods (tea, sugar, manufactured items)</p>
<p><strong>"Oriental" bazaars like "Araby":</strong>
- Marketed to middle class with disposable income
- Promoted "Eastern" fantasy and exoticism
- Commercial reality often disappointed romantic expectations
- Exotic goods remained expensive luxuries</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="transportation-and-the-mobility-paradox">Transportation and the Mobility Paradox</h2>
<p><strong>Modern infrastructure included:</strong>
- Electric tram system providing efficient public transport
- Railway connections to other Irish cities and Britain
- Telegraph system for rapid communication
- Multiple daily postal deliveries</p>
<p>While technology enabled movement and communication, economic constraints severely limited actual mobility for the working class. Psychological barriers often proved the strongest obstacles to change.</p>

<h2 id="formal-elements">Formal Elements</h2>
<p>(from Abrams &amp; Harpham)</p>
<h3 id="stream-of-consciousness">Stream of consciousness</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Describes the unbroken flow of perceptions, memories, thoughts, and feelings in the waking mind; it has since been adopted to describe a narrative method in modern fiction. Long passages of introspection, in which the narrator records in detail what passes through a character’s awareness... As it has been refined since the 1920s, “stream of consciousness” is the name applied specifically to a mode of narration that undertakes to reproduce the full spectrum and continuous flow of a character’s mental process, in which sense perceptions mingle with conscious and half-conscious thoughts, memories, expectations, feelings, and random associations. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="interior-monologue">Interior monologue</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Reserved for that species of stream of consciousness which undertakes to present to the reader the course and rhythm of consciousness precisely as it occurs in a character’s mind. In interior monologue the author does not intervene, or at any rate intervenes minimally, as describer, guide, or commentator, and does not tidy the vagaries of the mental process into grammatical sentences or into a logical or coherent order. The interior monologue, in its radical form, is sometimes described as the exact presentation of the process of consciousness; but because sense perceptions, mental images, feelings, and some aspects of thought itself are non-verbal, it is clear that the author can present these elements only by converting them into some sort of verbal equivalent. </p>
<p>James Joyce developed a variety of devices for stream-of-consciousness narrative in <em>Ulysses</em> (1922). Here is a passage of interior monologue from the “Lestrygonians” episode, in which Leopold Bloom saunters through Dublin, observing and musing: <em>Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugar-sticky girl shoveling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school treat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His Majesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne, sucking red jujubes white.</em> </p>

<h3 id="find-textual-evidence-for-every-argument">Find textual evidence for every argument.</h3>
<h4 id="araby">"Araby"</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The story is told by an older narrator remembering his younger self. Where do we detect the mature narrator's irony breaking through? How does this double perspective shape our reading of the boy's romantic quest?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The boy imagines carrying a "chalice" through hostile crowds and turns Mangan's sister into an object of religious devotion, like in a hero's quest. What does this confusion of spiritual and sexual awakening reveal about Dublin's Catholic culture? Consider the dead priest's library in this context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Araby the bazaar promises Eastern enchantment but is a disappointment. How does Joyce construct this anticlimax? What exactly does the boy realize when he sees himself as "a creature driven and derided by vanity"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the "blind" street to the dark bazaar where his eyes burn with "anguish and anger": trace the imagery of sight and blindness and light and darkness. Why is Mangan's sister always glimpsed in fragments or silhouettes?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="eveline">"Eveline"</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Joyce employs free indirect discourse to give us access to Eveline's consciousness while maintaining narrative distance. How does this technique allow us to simultaneously sympathize with and critique Eveline's paralysis? Identify moments where the narrative voice seems to merge with or separate from Eveline's thoughts. What is the effect of the shift to objective narration in the final dock scene?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dust pervades Eveline's world and memories. How does this connect to her mother's dying words and her promise to "keep the home together"? What kind of life do Dublin women inherit?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eveline constructs two opposing narratives: the familiar suffering of home versus the uncertain promise of Buenos Aires with Frank. How does Joyce complicate any simple reading of Frank as either savior or seducer? Analyze how Eveline's memories shift and contradict themselves. What role does her inability to construct a coherent narrative of her own life play in her final paralysis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story moves from dusty interior to open sea, a journey Eveline cannot complete. What transforms her at the barrier? Why does she show Frank "no sign of love or farewell or recognition"?</p>
</li>
</ol>
