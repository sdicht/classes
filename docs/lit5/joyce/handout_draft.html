<h2 id="background-for-reading-araby-and-eveline">Background for Reading "Araby" and "Eveline"</h2>
<p>This handout provides essential historical context for understanding James Joyce's Dublin stories. Use it as reference while reading to better understand the economic, social, and cultural constraints that shape his characters' choices.</p>
<h2 id="dublins-economic-decline">Dublin's Economic Decline</h2>
<p>By 1904, Dublin was a city in economic decline. With a population of approximately 300,000, it was no longer the second largest city in the British Isles as it had been at its peak. The main sources of employment were building trades, brewing, domestic service, and dock work—all offering limited opportunities for advancement. </p>
<p>Economic constraints were severe. A shop girl like Eveline might earn 7 shillings per week, while basic rent for modest accommodation cost 15 shillings weekly. This impossible arithmetic meant that many families lived in poverty, often in overcrowded tenements created from subdivided Georgian townhouses. The constant flow of emigration to America and Australia reflected these harsh economic realities, as young people sought opportunities unavailable in Ireland.</p>
<h2 id="religious-demographics-and-social-power">Religious Demographics and Social Power</h2>
<p>Religious identity determined social and economic opportunities in Dublin. Catholics comprised 83% of the population but were mostly confined to working-class and lower middle-class positions. The Protestant minority of 17% dominated the professions, major businesses, and government positions.</p>
<p>Catholics faced systematic disadvantages. They were excluded from Trinity College (the Protestant university) until 1873, had limited access to law, medicine, and higher civil service positions, and found banking and major businesses largely controlled by Protestants. The Catholic University, founded only in 1854, was still developing its reputation. As a result, Catholics were clustered in lower-level jobs: clerks, shop assistants, and minor government officials.</p>
<h2 id="womens-legal-and-economic-constraints">Women's Legal and Economic Constraints</h2>
<p>Women's options were severely limited by both law and social convention. Under coverture laws, married women had no property rights—everything belonged legally to their husbands, who also controlled their wives' earnings and major decisions. For Catholics, divorce was virtually impossible, making marriage choices crucial and often irreversible.</p>
<p>Employment options for women were narrow. Domestic service was most common, employing women as maids, cooks, and housekeepers. Shop work, like Eveline's position "at the Stores," paid survival wages of about 7 shillings weekly. Teaching and nursing were available mainly to women in religious orders, while factory work was very limited in Dublin's service-based economy.</p>
<p>Marriage functioned as an economic reality rather than romantic choice. Marriages were often postponed to the late twenties or thirties due to economic necessity. Families saved for years to provide daughters with required dowries. Social pressure dictated that "a bad marriage with its aversions is better than free womanhood with its interests, dignity, and leisure." Spinsterhood meant economic vulnerability and social stigma.</p>
<h2 id="the-tenement-housing-crisis">The Tenement Housing Crisis</h2>
<p>Dublin's housing crisis resulted from the city's political decline after the 1801 Act of Union. Eighteenth-century Georgian townhouses, originally built for aristocracy, were abandoned when the aristocrats moved to London following the dissolution of the Irish Parliament. These elegant buildings were then subdivided into tenements, with entire families crowded into single rooms.</p>
<p>The statistics were appalling: 30% of tenements consisted of single-room occupancy, with up to 100 people living in one former mansion. Living conditions included one cold water tap per house (if any), shared outdoor toilets for entire buildings, and frequent outbreaks of typhoid, tuberculosis, and other diseases. Dublin had the highest death rate in Europe.</p>
<h2 id="catholic-church-social-control">Catholic Church Social Control</h2>
<p>The Catholic Church exercised pervasive authority over daily life and personal decisions. The educational system included National schools providing basic literacy for the working class, Christian Brothers schools for working-class boys, convent schools for girls, and Jesuit schools like Clongowes and Belvedere for middle-class Catholic boys.</p>
<p>The Church's moral authority extended beyond education. Weekly confession monitored personal behavior and thoughts. Temperance movements campaigned against alcohol consumption. Church guidance strictly controlled sexual behavior and marriage decisions. Reading material was censored to prevent exposure to "dangerous" books. This pervasive religious authority influenced the daily decisions and psychological development of Catholics like Joyce's characters.</p>
<h2 id="employment-patterns">Employment Patterns</h2>
<p>Men's employment clustered in certain areas. Government clerks worked in insurance offices and civil service positions. Shop assistants served in city center stores. Minor civil servants worked in post offices and municipal offices. Dock workers and building trades offered irregular employment. A small professional class in law and medicine remained mostly Protestant.</p>
<p>Women's employment was even more restricted. Domestic service was the largest employment category for women. Shop girls like Eveline worked "at the Stores" for survival wages. Seamstresses and milliners worked in clothing trades. Elementary school teaching was available for sufficiently educated women. For most women, marriage remained the only reliable path to economic security.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-irish-emigration">The Great Irish Emigration</h2>
<p>Between 1841 and 1921, approximately 8 million Irish people emigrated, with peak emigration occurring in the 1880s-1900s driven by economic desperation. America received 70% of emigrants, with Australia and Canada taking most others.</p>
<p>The typical emigrants were young adults aged 18-30 in their peak productive years. Unusually for global migration patterns, single women emigrated in large numbers. Both rural poor fleeing agricultural crisis and urban working class seeking better opportunities departed Ireland. Those with education and skills also left, creating a "brain drain" effect.</p>
<p>The cultural impact was profound. "American wakes" were farewell parties that assumed permanent separation from family and homeland. Letters and money sent home carried promises of new life and opportunity. Success stories were mixed—some emigrants prospered, but many faced exploitation and hardship in their new countries.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-movements">Cultural Movements</h2>
<p>The 1890s and 1900s saw significant cultural developments. The Irish Literary Revival, led by W.B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, promoted Celtic mythology and folklore. The Abbey Theatre, founded in 1904, developed an Irish dramatic tradition. These movements wrote in English but emphasized Irish themes and settings.</p>
<p>The Gaelic League, founded in 1893, promoted Irish language revival through cultural classes, traditional music, and Irish dancing. This movement connected to growing political nationalism and cultural independence.</p>
<p>Joyce maintained a skeptical distance from both movements. His cosmopolitan outlook favored seeing Dublin as a European city rather than an isolated "Celtic" culture. This perspective influenced his realistic rather than romantic treatment of Irish life.</p>
<h2 id="consumer-culture-and-modernity">Consumer Culture and Modernity</h2>
<p>Commercial changes were transforming Dublin life. Department stores began replacing traditional small shops. Advertising and brand names became common. Ready-made clothing competed with custom tailoring. Imported luxury goods like tea, sugar, and manufactured items became available to those who could afford them.</p>
<p>"Oriental" bazaars like the one in "Araby" were marketed to the growing middle class with disposable income. These events promoted "Eastern" fantasy and exoticism, though the commercial reality often disappointed romantic expectations. Consumer desire frequently exceeded economic capability, making exotic goods expensive luxury items available only to the wealthy.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-and-communication">Transportation and Communication</h2>
<p>Dublin's modern infrastructure included an electric tram system providing efficient public transport by the 1900s. Railway connections linked Dublin to other Irish cities and Britain. The telegraph system enabled rapid long-distance communication. Postal service provided multiple daily deliveries throughout the city.</p>
<p>However, a mobility paradox existed. While technology theoretically enabled movement and communication, economic constraints severely limited actual mobility for the working class. Often, psychological barriers proved the strongest obstacle to change, as characters like Eveline discover.</p>
<h2 id="using-this-context">Using This Context</h2>
<p>As you read Joyce's stories, consider how these historical realities shape character choices and psychology. Look for evidence of economic constraints, religious influence, class divisions, and the limited options available to young people in early twentieth-century Dublin. Joyce's "paralysis" theme becomes more meaningful when understood against this background of systematic social and economic limitations.</p>
<p>The stories gain depth when read as realistic social documents as well as artistic creations. Joyce's characters are not simply individual personalities but representatives of broader social conditions that trapped many young Irish people in cycles of poverty, limited opportunity, and unfulfilled dreams.</p>
